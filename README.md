# Minimal Noir project for a browser environment

## Prerequisites

- [nargo version 0.9.0](https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/nargo_installation#option-1-noirup)
- node

## How to run this

1. `npm i` to install dependencies

2. `nargo compile main` to generate your circuit in ACIR format. You should get a folder called `target` with `main.json` inside. Feel free to use whatever name, as long as you update the import in `ts/index.ts`.

3. `npm run dev` to run your frontend in development mode (open the console to see logs)
